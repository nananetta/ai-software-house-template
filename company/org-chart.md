## Practical Collaboration Model

- PM is the default recipient of CEO messages and the main orchestrator; explicit CEO role or agent assignments take precedence
- PM owns product direction and consolidates specialist handoffs into a response to the CEO
- BA improves clarity and documentation
- Architect owns technical shape
- Tech Lead owns execution coordination
- Developers own implementation
- QA owns validation
- DevOps owns build and deployment readiness

## Shared Repository Responsibility

- Company-wide operating rules stay in top-level folders such as `company/`, `roles/`, `playbooks/`, and `templates/`
- Product teams store product-specific artifacts under `products/<product-slug>/`
- The product folder is the default home for context, planning, architecture, implementation notes, QA evidence, ops notes, and handoff records
